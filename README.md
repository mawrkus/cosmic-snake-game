# 🕹️ Game & Music experiment: a Snake video game

A [snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) built with Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.

A quick note...
> The code is as-it-is: no linter, no tests and, in many places, the inconsistencies of experimenting with several design patterns and strategies to write a video game. The "game-objects" folder is my 1st attempt, the "component-based-entity-system" folder is my 2nd attempt.

## 🚀 Start

```shell
npm i && npm start
```
